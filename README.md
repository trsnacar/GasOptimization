# GasOptimization

The purpose of the GasOptimization contract is to demonstrate how to optimize gas usage in Solidity. It does this by using various techniques, such as loading input data into calldata, storing local variables in memory, and using short-circuit operations to avoid unnecessary gas usage.

The specific function in the contract, sumIfEvenAndLessThan99, takes an array of numbers as input and calculates the sum of all the even numbers that are less than 99. This is just an example of how these optimization techniques can be applied to a real-world scenario. The actual purpose of the contract will depend on how it is used in a larger application.
